# T-040: The trial of podvm

**Source:** `docs/design.md`, section 8, step 7; `docs/decisions.md`,
call C16.
**Category:** chore
**Milestone:** M5
**Priority:** P2
**Effort:** S
**Status:** partial

## Problem

podvm uses the blocking facade of `pod-relay` and `pod-term`. Its trial
needs its repository.

## Premise

- PodUtils/podvm is public: this session reads it through the mirror and
  a clone, which a trial needs; it writes nothing there. podvm takes
  `pod-term`, `pod-tls`, `pod-proxy`, `pod-relay` (feature `blocking`),
  `pod-services`, `pod-egress`, `pod-netstack` and `pod-todo`, in this
  order (PodUtils/podvm#194).

## Approach

adoption/podvm/: the commit, the patch; `adoption.yml` runs it. The first
trial is `pod-term` (podvm's line discipline), at podvm `0249527` (C21).

## Prove

```sh
gh workflow run adoption.yml -f consumer=podvm -f crate=pod-relay
```

## Start condition

podvm gave the commit of its rename (PodUtils/podvm#194: `0249527`). The
edition of podvm is not a condition: a crate of edition 2021 takes a
dependency of edition 2024; the patch raises podvm's `rust-version`.

## Done

2026-11-06, partial. The patch of the trial of `pod-term` (`784469a`), at podvm `0249527`:
`PodUtils/podvm:crates/podvm-ssh/src/session.rs` takes `pod_term::echo` and keeps its
supervisor; podvm's own 29 tests of the discipline pass on pod-term, with
two of them changed to pod-term's Home and End (the screen's cursor moves
with the line's); clippy of podvm's workspace, rustfmt, podvm's record
gate, the toolchains and the static binary `shell` pass
(`sh scripts/adoption.sh podvm pod-term`). podvm took `pod-term` at
`v0.3.0` in podvm `75ed306` (PodUtils/podvm#197): each line of the `.run`
passed there, `session_interactive` too (12 passed against sshd); the trial
leaves the directory of podvm. Left: the trials of `pod-tls` and `pod-proxy`
(the synchronous face, T-063), then the other crates of the order of
PodUtils/podvm#194.
