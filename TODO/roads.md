This file holds the entries of milestone M4: the other roads of podssh.
Each entry starts with a study (the API, the C on each target, the fork),
then follows the procedure of `docs/design.md`, section 8.

**Source:** `docs/design.md`, section 4 (M4).
**Category:** feature
**Milestone:** M4
**Priority:** P3
**Effort:** S
**Status:** open

## Problem

podssh carries a node's sessions through OpenTunnel.

## Premise

- Read: `PodUtils/podssh:crates/podssh-relay/src/opentunnel/` (2,563); it
  uses the generic cache files of `cache.rs` (`pod-core`).

## Approach

The study, then the procedure of `docs/design.md`, section 8.

# T-034: `pod-acme`: the ACME client

**Source:** `docs/design.md`, section 4 (M4).
**Category:** feature
**Milestone:** M4
**Priority:** P2
**Effort:** S
**Status:** open

## Problem

A public listener of podssh or podnet needs a certificate.

## Premise

- Read: `PodUtils/podssh:crates/podssh-cli/src/acme/` (1,372: TLS-ALPN-01,
  the keys on aws-lc-rs); its interop test runs against Pebble.

## Approach

The study, then the procedure of `docs/design.md`, section 8; the keys
through the provider of the caller.

## Prove

```sh
cargo test -p pod-acme
sh scripts/agent/check.sh
```

## Start condition

T-014 is done.

# T-035: `pod-egress`: the other roads out (via, VLESS, wstunnel, Wisp, Shadowsocks and more)

**Source:** `docs/design.md`, section 4 (M4).
**Category:** feature
**Milestone:** M4
**Priority:** P2
**Effort:** L
**Status:** open

## Problem

podssh has roads out that podnet does not have: an HTTPS proxy, VLESS,
wstunnel, Wisp, Shadowsocks, forwarders, meek, WebTunnel, EICE, IAP and
the Access client of Cloudflare.

## Premise

- Read: podssh-ws `via/`, `vless/`, `wstunnel/`, `wisp/`, `shadowsocks/`,
  `forwarder/`, `meek.rs`, `meek/`, `webtunnel.rs`, `pt.rs`, `eice/`,
  `iap/`, `cloudflare.rs` (about 10,000 lines), and podssh's interop
  workflows of `via`, `vless` and `wstunnel`.

## Approach

The study, then the procedure of `docs/design.md`, section 8; each road
is a `Dial`.

## Prove

```sh
cargo test -p pod-egress --all-features
sh scripts/agent/check.sh
```

## Start condition

T-016 is done.

# T-036: `pod-relay-serve`: the relay role and its mailbox

**Source:** `docs/design.md`, section 4 (M4).
**Category:** feature
**Milestone:** M4
**Priority:** P2
**Effort:** L
**Status:** open

## Problem

podssh serves the relay contract itself (the relay role), with a mailbox
server.

## Premise

- Read: `PodUtils/podssh:crates/podssh-relay/src/serve/` (13,192 with
  `serve/mailbox/`); `serve/` is the most changed module of podssh (100
  file changes in 50 commits).

## Approach

The study, then the procedure of `docs/design.md`, section 8.

## Prove

```sh
cargo test -p pod-relay-serve
sh scripts/agent/check.sh
```

## Start condition

T-026 and T-030 are done.

# T-037: `pod-iroh`: the iroh road

**Source:** `docs/design.md`, section 4 (M4).
**Category:** feature
**Milestone:** M4
**Priority:** P2
**Effort:** M
**Status:** open

## Problem

podssh carries sessions over QUIC between keys with iroh, through a relay
when UDP is refused.

## Premise

- Read: `PodUtils/podssh:crates/podssh-iroh` (3,640); iroh 1.4 with
  `tls-aws-lc-rs`; the patched iroh-relay of `PodUtils/podssh:vendor/iroh-relay`.
- aws-lc-sys is not proven on i686, arm, loongarch64 and powerpc64le musl
  (`docs/design.md`, section 7).

## Approach

The study (the static link on each target, ring where iroh allows it),
then the procedure of `docs/design.md`, section 8, with the fork in
vendor/.

## Prove

```sh
cargo test -p pod-iroh
sh scripts/agent/check.sh
```

## Start condition

T-031 is done.

# T-038: `pod-tor`: the Tor road through arti

**Source:** `docs/design.md`, section 4 (M4).
**Category:** feature
**Milestone:** M4
**Priority:** P3
**Effort:** S
**Status:** open

## Problem

podssh carries a stream through Tor with arti.

## Premise

- Read: `PodUtils/podssh:crates/podssh-tor` (938); arti with a bundled
  SQLite (C).

## Approach

The study (SQLite static on each target), then the procedure of
`docs/design.md`, section 8.

## Prove

```sh
cargo test -p pod-tor
sh scripts/agent/check.sh
```

## Start condition

T-035 is done.

# T-039: `pod-ts`: a Tailscale node in the process

**Source:** `docs/design.md`, section 4 (M4); `docs/decisions.md`, call
C12.
**Category:** feature
**Milestone:** M4
**Priority:** P2
**Effort:** L
**Status:** open

## Problem

podssh runs a tailnet node in its process on a fork of tailscale-rs with
29 patches (DERP over WebSocket, proxies, reconnect).

## Premise

- Read: `PodUtils/podssh:crates/podssh-ts` (895);
  `PodUtils/podssh:vendor/tailscale-rs` (70,135 lines, 40 manifests) and
  its patches; `tailscale` 0.6.1 on crates.io; the headscale harness of
  podssh.

## Approach

The study (the fork against upstream, the static link, aws-lc on each
target), then the procedure of `docs/design.md`, section 8, with the fork
in vendor/.

## Prove

```sh
cargo test -p pod-ts
sh scripts/agent/check.sh
```

## Start condition

T-014 is done.
