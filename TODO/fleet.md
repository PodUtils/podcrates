This file holds the entries of milestone M8: the shared crates for the asks of GitHub #35 (cfb) and #36
(githome). `docs/research/fleet/asks.md` routes each ask. Each crate follows the procedure of
`docs/design.md`, section 8.

# T-099: `pod-broker`: the egress broker: per-job policy, one resolve, the upstream chain, the audit and the drop (GitHub #35, #36)

**Source:** GitHub #35 (A-X-05, A-V-03, A-N-13, A-S-11) and GitHub #36 (G-04)
**Category:** feature
**Milestone:** M8
**Priority:** P1
**Effort:** L
**Status:** done

## Problem

cfb (A-X-05, A-V-03, A-N-13, A-S-11) and githome (G-04) need one egress proxy for a job. cfb wants an
allow-list by default. githome wants open egress by default with fixed denies. `pod-egress` names the roads
of T-035, so the broker is a new crate (call C25).

## Premise

- Read: the vocabulary of PodUtils/podvm#184 (407, 403, 502, 504), the rules of `podnet pod` and `warp proxy`.
- Not read: a TLS end in any of them. T-100 adds it.
- Not measured: the broker.

## Approach

Add the crate. A policy schema with two modes: allow-list, and open with fixed denies that no policy lifts
(metadata, private, link-local, host addresses, `fd00:ec2::254`). Host and path prefix on whole segments.
One resolve with a deny file. The CONNECT target, the Host header and the SNI must agree (421). An ambiguous
target gets 400. A chain to the upstream proxy. One JSON audit line for each connection with job id, host,
port, decision and bytes, and no secret value. `load` and `drop` on a Unix socket with JSON lines. Drop at
the TTL. The crate is a library: each product hosts it in a thin `main` (call C27).

## Prove

```sh
cargo test -p pod-broker --all-features
sh scripts/agent/check.sh
```

## Done

2026-11-09, the commit of this entry. New crate `crates/pod-broker` (library only, C27): the policy of
version 1 in JSON and TOML (`schemas/broker-policy.v1.schema.json`), the fixed denies, the denies of the
host and its deny file, the strict reading of a target (400), 421 on a `Host` that differs, 407, 403, 502
and 504, one resolve with a dial of the checked addresses only (C28), the upstream chain through
`pod_proxy::Dialer`, the jobs with `load`, `drop`, `list` and the TTL on a control socket of mode 0600,
one JSON audit line for each connection with no secret value (C31), and the seam `TunnelEnd` for T-100
(C29). The fuzz target `broker_target` of the request target. The static probe calls the crate.
`cargo test -p pod-broker --all-features`: 55 passed (8 unit, 47 in `tests/`), 30 runs in a loop with no
failure. The planted path in an audit line fails `no_audit_line_holds_a_planted_secret`.
`cargo test --manifest-path fuzz/Cargo.toml --lib`: 2 passed. `sh scripts/agent/check.sh`: fmt 0,
clippy 0, doc 0, record 0, size 0, test 0; the static build waits for CI (no zig here), and the static probe
runs on the host with the line of `pod-broker`.

# T-100: `pod-broker`: TLS end with a CA for each job, placeholder credentials and the scrub of answers (GitHub #35, #36)

**Source:** GitHub #35 (A-X-05, A-V-03, A-N-13) and GitHub #36 (G-04)
**Category:** feature
**Milestone:** M8
**Priority:** P1
**Effort:** L
**Status:** open

## Problem

The swap of a placeholder credential for the real one needs the TLS end of the broker. The job must trust
the CA of the broker and must never see the real value.

## Premise

- Read: the asks in `docs/research/fleet/asks.md`.
- Not measured: the swap.

## Approach

A CA for each job, written as a bundle file; the variables `SSL_CERT_FILE`, `GIT_SSL_CAINFO`,
`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` and `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` name it. Swap the placeholder in a header, in Basic
authentication, in a query and in a body. Put the placeholder back in answers. A test plants a secret and
proves that no log line holds it. A fuzz target of the request target.

## Prove

```sh
cargo test -p pod-broker --all-features
sh scripts/fuzz.sh 60
```

## Start condition

T-099 is done.

# T-102: `pod-unit`: hardened service units for systemd, launchd and Windows, with no secret in a unit (GitHub #35)

**Source:** GitHub #35 (A-N-11, A-S-02, A-S-18, A-N-12, A-C-02, A-C-07)
**Category:** feature
**Milestone:** M8
**Priority:** P1
**Effort:** M
**Status:** open

## Problem

podssh and podnet each write their own units (user units, crontab, LaunchAgent, Windows). cfb needs system
units with a named user and hardening, and no token in a unit.

## Premise

- Read: `PodUtils/podssh:crates/podssh-cli/src/node_install/` and `PodUtils/podnet:src/autostart.rs` in the asks.
- Not measured: `systemd-analyze security` of a unit.

## Approach

Import `node_install/` of podssh as the base, and merge `autostart.rs` of podnet. Add system units with
`User=`, `NoNewPrivileges`, `ProtectSystem=strict`, an empty capability set, `EnvironmentFile` or a
credential file, and `RestartPreventExitStatus`. Render to text for `--print-unit`. Uninstall leaves
nothing. The command line stays in each product (call C27).

## Prove

```sh
cargo test -p pod-unit --all-features
sh scripts/agent/check.sh
```

A test plants a token and fails. `ci.yml` runs `systemd-analyze verify`.

# T-103: `pod-control`: one JSON control API on a Unix socket or a named pipe (GitHub #35, #36)

**Source:** GitHub #35 (A-X-15, A-N-03) and GitHub #36 (G-08)
**Category:** feature
**Milestone:** M8
**Priority:** P1
**Effort:** M
**Status:** open

## Problem

Each long-running tool needs the same local control API. cfb must not parse human output. G-08 needs
`drain`.

## Premise

- Read: the JSON of podnet `src/status.rs` (schema 1) and podssh `status`.
- Not measured: a client against two tools.

## Approach

JSON lines with a schema version in each answer. The methods `version`, `status`, `metrics`, `reload`,
`drain` and `stop`. One error code for an unknown method. A check of the peer user. A Unix socket and a
Windows named pipe. The JSON Schema goes to `schemas/`. A conformance test that a consumer runs.

## Prove

```sh
cargo test -p pod-control --all-features
sh scripts/agent/check.sh
```

# T-104: `pod-release`: the release index, its writer for CI and its verifier (GitHub #35, #36)

**Source:** GitHub #35 (A-X-13, A-X-24, A-X-02) and GitHub #36 (G-11)
**Category:** feature
**Milestone:** M8
**Priority:** P1
**Effort:** M
**Status:** open

## Problem

cfb pins each file by SHA-256 and by the asks that a release passes. podnet and podssh each verify a
Sigstore bundle of `SHA256SUMS` in their own code. The installer `podutils` and `podnode` need one index.

## Premise

- Read: podnet `src/update.rs` and podssh `update/sigstore.rs` in the asks.
- Not measured: the verifier.

## Approach

One index schema (version, date, targets, file SHA-256, signature, SBOM link, acceptance). The writer is a
shared CI script. The verifier comes from podnet and podssh, with the release identity as a setting (the
ruling "Services: what stays" keeps the identity with each consumer). The JSON Schema goes to `schemas/`.

## Prove

```sh
cargo test -p pod-release --all-features
sh scripts/agent/check.sh
```

A test changes one byte and the verifier fails.

# T-106: `pod-testkit`: the stand-ins of the edge, the relay and the WARP API as binaries for a consumer's CI (GitHub #35, #36)

**Source:** GitHub #35 (A-X-18) and GitHub #36 (G-10)
**Category:** feature
**Milestone:** M8
**Priority:** P2
**Effort:** M
**Status:** open

## Problem

cfb and podrunner need loopback stand-ins as programs, so that their CI drives real binaries with no
internet route.

## Premise

- Read: podssh `scripts/fake-*.py`, the test host of podnet, T-028 (it moves the WARP stand-ins).
- Not measured: a stand-in as a binary.

## Approach

A feature of `pod-testkit` builds the stand-ins of the edge, the relay and the WARP API as binaries, with
documented ports and fixtures. Each speaks bytes and HTTP only (`docs/design.md`, section 4). The fake
GitHub API and the fake control plane stay in their projects. The HTTP base serves the fake forge job
source of G-10.

## Prove

```sh
cargo test -p pod-testkit --all-features
sh scripts/agent/check.sh
```

## Start condition

T-025, T-028 and T-029 moved their stand-ins to `pod-testkit`.

# T-146: `podrunner`: run GitHub CI and other CI on any machine (the plan, GitHub #47)

**Source:** the owner, 2026-11-10 ("the tool that lets me run GitHub or other CI on any machine"); GitHub #47; A-X-01 of #35; G-01 to G-12 of #36.
**Category:** research
**Milestone:** M8
**Priority:** P2
**Effort:** L
**Status:** open

## Problem

The owner asks for one tool that runs GitHub CI, and other CI, on any
machine: a host with no root, no namespaces, no docker daemon and a proxy
for the only way out.

## Premise

- Read: `docs/research/ci/podrunner-plan.md` (the plan, with its sources);
  `docs/research/fleet/asks.md`; podvm's parity table.
- Not measured: the official runner under podvm (phase 0 of the plan).

## Approach

The plan and GitHub #47 give the phases with their checklists:

- Phase 0 (measure) and the podvm items of phase 1 are podvm work: they
  go now, in podvm's record.
- `podrunner` (a static launcher of the official `actions/runner`, one
  fresh podvm unit for each job) and the crate `pod-dockerapi` (a Docker
  Engine API subset over podvm, one socket for each job) wait for Q8 to
  Q14 (`TODO/PROGRESS.md`).
- A native Rust runner is a conditional phase 5.

## Prove

The checklist of GitHub #47: each item gets its own entry and proof. The
plan passes the path check:

```sh
python3 -I scripts/check-design-paths.py
```
