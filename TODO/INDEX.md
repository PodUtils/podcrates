# Index

Each entry of the work record, one row each, sorted by id. The entry is in
the area file that its row links. It closes there, with its Prove run and
the result written.

`TODO/PROGRESS.md` has the only work order. `TODO/RULES.md` gives the rules
of the record. `TODO/issues.md` maps each GitHub issue to its entries.

`cargo todo set` and `cargo todo counts` derive the counts from the rows.
`cargo todo check` makes sure that the counts, the rows and the entries
agree.

## Values

**Priority.**

- **P0**: correctness fails, data is lost, or the process stops.
- **P1**: a crate that a consumer waits for, or a check that the rules
  need.
- **P2**: worth doing; nothing is wrong without it.
- **P3**: worth recording, so that nobody must find it again.

**Effort.** S is less than one day. M is some days. L is one week. There
is no XL: make two entries.

**Status.** `open`, `partial`, `blocked` or `done` (`TODO/RULES.md`).

**Milestone.** `M0` to `M5`, as in `TODO/ROADMAP.md`: M0 Foundation, M1
Transport, M2 Relay, M3 Adapters, M4 Roads, M5 Upkeep.

**Category.** `defect`, `feature`, `measurement`, `release`, `chore`,
`research` or `docs`.
